Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Pygame)

Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and Pygame. The game allows a player to compete against an AI opponent or another player in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
How to Play

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Player X (human) and Player O (AI or human) take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark.
The game checks for a win condition after each move.
If a player aligns three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win!
If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
Click the restart button or press any key to start a new round.
